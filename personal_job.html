    <h4 class="main_header">Formalizing Informal Jobs and Third Party Contracts</h4>
    <p>Our new flagship product is focused on the bottom of the pyramid (BOP), a population whose incomes are less than KES 1,000 a day or KES 30,000 per month. In the developing world, this category of people are mainly engaged in informal jobs or businesses. Besides low earnings, this group lack social security. Most do not have medical cover and rarely are they enrolled in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) or any private pension scheme meaning that they have no retirement’s benefits.  Additionally, the informality of their jobs makes it difficult for this group of people to participate in the highly beneficial savings, credit and co-operative organizations (Sacco) movement where formal workers get cheaper loans. The banks are also not able to fund informal workers due to the lack of evidence on their financial track record.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Buy Future Associates (BFA) acknowledges the employers’ constraints in formalizing low level jobs. Though the NSSF and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) requires employers to register and remit contributions for their workers, the hassles of making monthly returns are not worth it for employers having few employees. This is the case for many domestic workers (house helps, gardeners and personal drivers). The employees themselves have the liberty to register on their own but such discipline is a challenge even to highly skilled workers. BFA pools together workers and take over the responsibility of filing returns on behalf of the employer. Essentially, the workers will be registered as BFA employees who for practical purposes work with BFA clients (the employers). BFA will prepare payroll for registered workers, issue pay slips and forward their wages in a regular system that will increase chances for the workers access to credit. Payment may be either through bank or Mpesa.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Essentially, we contract the workers through a third party contract. A third party contract is made by an entity on behalf of another. BFA will contractually take on employees who the organization want to outsource or those who have hitherto been treated as informal workers. We then fulfil all employer requirements on behalf of the principal employer. Our target includes construction workers, retail trade employees, small miners, small manufacturing firms, non-core positions like drivers, clerks, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Besides the BOP workers, we also focus on new entrants into the Kenyan market who are yet to fully establish and would want to have employees’ temporarily handled by an agency.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Benefits for the employers</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compliance with the employment statutory requirements; thereby removing fear of harassment by law enforcement agencies</li>
        <li>Satisfaction in that one is affording the workers some minimum working conditions and benefits</li>
        <li>A changed perception of the workers as they see themselves as formal workers bound by certain standards. This may lead to more stable workers who will not change jobs every few months</li>
        <li>Removal of burden of taking responsibility for medical bills when workers are hospitalized</li>
        <li>Pooled Work Injury Benefit that is not feasible for employers with less than five employees</li>
        <li>Savings by using outsourced services as opposed to hiring internal staff</li>
        <li>Ease in dealing with temporary staff who now do not have to get into the organization’s payroll and may be subject to different terms of service</li>
        <li>Ability to give regular employment contracts even when organization has not fully established itself in the market.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><i>Benefits for the employees</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pay slips on monthly  basis which is a requirement by most lenders for credit appraisal</li>
        <li>Evidence of salary remittance through the bank or Mpesa thereby allowing for use of this as evidence for ease of accessing credit facilities</li>
        <li>Medical and retirement benefits through NHIF and NSSF</li>
        <li>Work Injury Benefit as per the Work Injury Benefit Act (WIBA)</li>
        <li>Enforceable employment terms and conditions including tracked leave</li>
        <li>Potential to form savings and credit co-operative society for easy access to cheaper credit</li>
        <li>Minimum wage as per the applicable labour laws in the absence of a defined collective bargaining agreement   BFA insists on minimum wages for staff</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><i>Some Drawbacks</i></p>
    <p>Whereas it is the responsibility of every citizen to pay taxes, many Kenyans enjoy being left out of the tax net. Formalization will definitely come with the responsibility of filing monthly Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes. It is however important to note that the amount of taxes will be very low for low income earners. For example, the income tax on a salary of Ksh. 20,000 per month is less than Ksh. 1,000 or less than 5%.</p>
